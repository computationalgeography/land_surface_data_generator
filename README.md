High resolution land surface data with a global coverage is a key requirement as input to global simulation models of, for instance, water resources, air pollution, and land use change.
Processing, reproducing and sharing inputs and derived products is a reoccurring challenge due to the amount of intermediate and final data, often implied by a hyper-resolution modelling requirement.

This Python based processing workflow provides a straightforward creation of input data for raster-based global simulation models.
